## feed.json.erb

‘feed.json.erb’ is a [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) template for [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com)’s official blog extension (middleman-blog). Drop it into your Middleman project’s *source* folder at *source/feed.json.erb* to serve up /feed.json.

## custom.json.erb

‘custom.json.erb’ is a [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org) template for [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) which uses Middleman’s Sitemap to select which resources to include in the feed. In this case, it’s what I used to create a feed for my *Dev Series* at [http://shawnbaden.com/dev/series](http://shawnbaden.com/dev/series).
